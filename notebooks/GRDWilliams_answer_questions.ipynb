      "[2]\n",
      " To study this, the research team created a unique keyboard through which Ai and the other chimpanzees at KUPRI could interact with a computer –– the computer was used to standardize the studies and reduce variation that might be introduced by human researchers, and because the mechanism could be easily used in comparative studies on humans.\n",
      "[1]\n",
      " With this method, researchers have studied Ai’s memory, number-learning, and perception of color. Matsuzawa wrote that Ai was “the first chimpanzee who learned to use Arabic numerals to represent numbers,” and her ordering of different shades and hues of \n",

      " This is similar to the size of some small chimpanzee groups in the wild, where in some places with stable food supplies group size hovers at around 20 chimpanzees.\n",
      "[5]\n",

      "[6]\n",
      " Matsuzawa wrote that:\n",
      "Two almost identical booths are placed side by side. There is a door between the two booths that can alternately be opened to connect the two areas, closed to separate the two individuals, or positioned half-open to allow the young chimpanzee to crawl from one area to the other while preventing the mother chimpanzee from entering the neighboring booth.\n",

      "A cat whose pictures went viral for regularly visiting a railway station is releasing a Christmas single. Four-year-old Nala has been delighting commuters who have been taking photos of her at Stevenage station. Owner Natasha Ambler revealed the cat was releasing a single called Meow and has been approached for a book deal. The ginger tabby has also recorded a video for the song due to be released this week, under the name Nala the Station Cat. It has been produced by Danny Kirsch, who wrote it with Joe Killington, while Nala is also co-credited as a songwriter, as well as a vocalist. Ms Ambler said \"we want to spread the happiness that Stevenage has had, and she's had on socials to the world\". The single is officially released on Wednesday and BBC Three Counties Radio's Justin Dealey gave the single an exclusive first play on Sunday. \"I'm slightly lost for words,\" said the presenter after the song finished. Nala's owner replied: \"So am I to be fair.\" The musical cat does not yet have an agent and her owner said \"we're all doing our emails ourselves; it's quite new to us\". \"We'll start small and hopefully she gets in the charts, but number one would be fantastic,\" she added. Charity campaigners LadBaby have filled the coveted Christmas number one single spot every year for the last five years. All proceeds from the single will be donated to the RSPCA and Stevenage homelessness charity Feed Up Warm Up. The music video, filmed at Stevenage railway station, will be unveiled before Christmas.

       "'A cat whose pictures went viral for regularly visiting a railway station is releasing a Christmas single. Four-year-old Nala has been delighting commuters who have been taking photos of her at Stevenage station. Owner Natasha Ambler revealed the cat was releasing a single called Meow and has been approached for a book deal. The ginger tabby has also recorded a video for the song due to be released this week, under the name Nala the Station Cat. It has been produced by Danny Kirsch, who wrote it with Joe Killington, while Nala is also co-credited as a songwriter, as well as a vocalist. Ms Ambler said \"we want to spread the happiness that Stevenage has had, and she\\'s had on socials to the world\". The single is officially released on Wednesday and BBC Three Counties Radio\\'s Justin Dealey gave the single an exclusive first play on Sunday. \"I\\'m slightly lost for words,\" said the presenter after the song finished. Nala\\'s owner replied: \"So am I to be fair.\" The musical cat does not yet have an agent and her owner said \"we\\'re all doing our emails ourselves; it\\'s quite new to us\". \"We\\'ll start small and hopefully she gets in the charts, but number one would be fantastic,\" she added. Charity campaigners LadBaby have filled the coveted Christmas number one single spot every year for the last five years. All proceeds from the single will be donated to the RSPCA and Stevenage homelessness charity Feed Up Warm Up. The music video, filmed at Stevenage railway station, will be unveiled before Christmas.
