Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".   \n",

      "A cat whose pictures went viral for regularly visiting a railway station is releasing a Christmas single. Four-year-old Nala has been delighting commuters who have been taking photos of her at Stevenage station. Owner Natasha Ambler revealed the cat was releasing a single called Meow and has been approached for a book deal. The ginger tabby has also recorded a video for the song due to be released this week, under the name Nala the Station Cat. It has been produced by Danny Kirsch, who wrote it with Joe Killington, while Nala is also co-credited as a songwriter, as well as a vocalist. Ms Ambler said \"we want to spread the happiness that Stevenage has had, and she's had on socials to the world\". The single is officially released on Wednesday and BBC Three Counties Radio's Justin Dealey gave the single an exclusive first play on Sunday. \"I'm slightly lost for words,\" said the presenter after the song finished. Nala's owner replied: \"So am I to be fair.\" The musical cat does not yet have an agent and her owner said \"we're all doing our emails ourselves; it's quite new to us\". \"We'll start small and hopefully she gets in the charts, but number one would be fantastic,\" she added. Charity campaigners LadBaby have filled the coveted Christmas number one single spot every year for the last five years. All proceeds from the single will be donated to the RSPCA and Stevenage homelessness charity Feed Up Warm Up. The music video, filmed at Stevenage railway station, will be unveiled before Christmas.
